#### Empress; a text "enhancement" tool
A tool to enhance a given text file for great good.

##### How to use:
./empress.rkt [file(.ext)] (> newfile)

a [file] is required, but an (.extension) is not. empress always prints to stdout if it is not piped to a file.

Currently only supports plaintext files. Extension optional.
